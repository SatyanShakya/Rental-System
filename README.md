This is a dynamic fullstack Cycle rental system website made by using php for my College Project.

1.1 Background
The project “Cycle Rental System” is designed to help the customers to take Cycles for
rent for certain period. Using this system, people can register as user who wants to take
cycles on rent.

The project, “Cycle Rental System” is developed to keep all the detailed records of total
rented cycles. Sometimes there might be error while keeping record in a system if
records are recorded manually. There may be human errors while recording so to
prevent these problems, Cycle Rental System is developed. Sometimes same named
customer may visit our company, so while recording manually, the records may be
replaced.
Hence, to prevent and solve these circumstances and make work effective and easy for
both customers and the company, “Cycle Rental System” is developed.
